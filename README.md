# E-Business-Website-
This project is for my course E-Business Systems in master's program


I have developed this project in less than one month.Due to the time constraint,I didn't exactly commented lines of code in the files.

**To know the details about the project one can go through the documentation folder and find all the regarding files.**

This project is about building a small e-commerce website where one can keep place orders and get the order-id from the website.

On the bank-end this system connects to Bank company,Shipping Company and IT Company by using socket programming and verifies with the bank and verifies if the customer had enough money his account or not and process accordingly.
If successful with the bank it moves to shipping to place order once done the order will be recorded by IT company.

Bank,Shipping and IT companies are hold by other students in the class and they act respectively.

I have done some extra work to create a **plugin** to help other students with calling bank,shipping and IT companies if everthing went successfully it returns 0 saying order placed otherwise it gives error and gives the problem.
The plugin needs two have date in two input files and one needs to call callMe.java program to start the process.


Thank You,
